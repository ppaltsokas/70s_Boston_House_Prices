# 70s_Boston_House_Prices
This project is a comprehensive analysis and application of multivariable linear regression techniques to predict housing prices in 1970s Boston. Developed as part of the '100 Days of Code' challenge, it showcases the practical use of data science principles and Python programming skills.

Leveraging a historical dataset containing details of various houses in Boston, the project employs Pythonâ€™s pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing the regression model. The goal was to accurately predict the prices of houses based on multiple factors such as crime rate, property tax rates, number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers, among others.

Key aspects of the project include data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different variables, feature selection to identify the most relevant predictors, and model evaluation to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
